# Gupil - AI capabilities in your browser.

This is a personal project to create a Webextension that allows to "chat" with a webpage content using a LLM directly from the browser.

![Example of use](./img/gupil_example.png)

It also provides basic completion support for text areas (default shortcut: Alt+Q).

This extension is primarily developed for Firefox, but I will try to keep it Chrome-compatible.

This extension aims at giving full control to the user, including by supporting self-hosted LLM providers. I do not intent to monetize it.
